                <h2>BAPU</h2>
                <p3> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[4]
                    anti-colonial nationalist[5] and political ethicist[6] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead
                    the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.[7] He inspired movements for
                    civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled",
                    "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.[8][9]
                </p3><br>
                <p4>
                    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple,
                    London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where
                    he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an
                    Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that
                    Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In
                    1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban
                    labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.</p4><br>
                <p5>
                    Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for
                    easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending
                    untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven
                    with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a
                    self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of
                    both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians,
                    Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt
                    March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and
                    for many years in both South Africa and India.</p5><br>
                <p6>
                    Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early
                    1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British
                    India.[10] In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire[10] was
                    partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan.[11] As many
                    displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke
                    out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence,
                    Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he
                    undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi
                    on 12 January 1948 when he was 78,[12][13][14][15] also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to
                    pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan,[16][17][18][19] which the Indian government[20] had been
                    resisting.[21][22][23][24][25] Although the Government of India relented,[26] as did the religious
                    rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both Pakistan and Indian
                    Muslims spread among some Hindus in India.[27][28][15] Among these was Nathuram Godse,[29] a
                    militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India,[30][31] who assassinated Gandhi by firing three
                    bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.[32][33][34][35]

                    Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and
                    worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered the Father of the Nation in
                    India[36][37] and is commonly called Bapu[38] (Gujarati endearment for 'father',[39]
                    'papa'[39][40]).</p7>

                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <hr>
                <h5>Early life and background</h5>
                <p8>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[41] was born on 2 October 1869[42] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania
                    family[43][44] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula
                    and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj.
                    His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of
                    Porbandar state.[45][5] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then
                    Junagadh State.</p8><br>
                <p9>Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state
                    administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[47] During his tenure, he married four
                    times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third
                    marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he
                    married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[47] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava
                    family.[48] Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c.
                    1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).</p9><br>
                <p10>On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless
                    ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described
                    by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite
                    pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."[51] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and
                    king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he states
                    that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted
                    Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and
                    love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters</p10><br>
                <p11>
                    he family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother
                    Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family.[54][55] Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste
                    in the varna of Vaishya.[56] His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami
                    tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection
                    of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the
                    Quran and the Bible.[55][57] Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who
                    "would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows
                    and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her."
                </p11><br>
                <p12>
                    In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became
                    a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than
                    Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a
                    measure of security.[59] In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of
                    Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.[60]

                    At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments
                    of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.[60] At the age of 11, he joined the
                    High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School.[62] He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a
                    shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school
                    lessons.
